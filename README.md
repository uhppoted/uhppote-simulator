## Installation

### Docker

A public _Docker_ image is published to [ghcr.io](https://github.com/uhppoted?tab=packages&repo_name=uhppote-simulator). The image:
- includes a _getting started_ sample controller\
- is configured to store emulated controllers in /usr/local/etc/uhppoted/simulator

#### `docker compose`

A sample Docker `compose` configuration is provided in the [`docker/compose`](docker/compose) folder. 

To run the example, download and extract the [zipped](docker/compose.zip) scripts and supporting files into folder
of your choice and then:
```
cd <compose folder>
docker compose up
```

The emulated controllers can be managed using the [REST API](#rest-api).

#### `docker run`

To start a simulator using Docker `run`:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/uhppoted/simulator:latest
docker run --detach --publish 8000:8000 --publish 60000:60000/udp --name simulator \
           --mount source=uhppoted,target=/usr/local/etc/uhppoted \
           --rm ghcr.io/uhppoted/simulator
```

The emulated controllers can be managed using the REST API [REST API](#rest-api).

#### `docker build`

For inclusion in a Dockerfile:
```
FROM ghcr.io/uhppoted/simulator:latest
```

### Building from source

Assuming you have `Go` and `make` installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-simulator.git
cd uhppote-simulator
make build
```

If you prefer not to use `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-simulator.git
cd uhppote-simulator
mkdir bin
go build -trimpath -o bin ./...
```

## REST API

The simulator provides a REST API to simulate user actions and manage controllers:

- swipe card
- supervisor passcode
- open door
- close door
- press button
- list controllers
- create controller
- delete controller

The actions may be invoked:
- from the command line using _curl_ 
- using the [REST.py](scripts) script
- using one of the many [Postman-like](https://www.postman.com/) tools available. Postman scripts can be found in
  the [scripts](scripts) folder
- using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io) with the [OpenAPI](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-simulator/blob/main/documentation/simulator-api.yaml) YAML file.

The default port is 8000.

### `swipe-card`

PIN            card PIN e.g.7531
```
```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/uhppote/simulator/405419896/cards/10058400" -H "accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"start-date": "2024-01-01", "end-date": "2024-12-31", "doors": [1,2,4], "PIN": 7531}'
```

## NOTES

### `put-card`

1. The UHPPOTE access controller has a weird behaviour around the PIN field. According to the SDK 
documentation, valid PINs are in the range 0 to 999999. However the controller will accept a 
PIN number out of that range and only keep the lower 7 nibbles of the 32-bit unsigned value.
e.g:

| PIN     | Hex value | Stored as (hex) | Retrieved as (hex) | Retrieved as (decimal) |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| 0       | 0x000000  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
| 999999  | 0x0f423f  | 0x0f423f        | 0x0f423f           | 999999                 |
| 1000000 | 0x0f4240  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
| 1000001 | 0x0f4241  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
| 1048576 | 0x100000  | 0x000000        | 0x000000           | 0                      |
| 1048577 | 0x100001  | 0x000000        | 0x000001           | 1                      |
| 1999999 | 0x1E847F  | 0x0E847F        | 0x000001           | 951423                 |

Note that by design, the simulator does not emulate this behaviour, on the grounds that it is probably a 
version specific bug.

2. The emulated controller does not accept cards with a 'zero' start or end date - the REST _put-card_ API 
can be used to add cards without valid start/end dates for testing.


### `restore-default-parameters`

`restore-default-parameters` has (for practical reasons) NOT been validated against an actual controller. Resetting
the simulator:
- clears the internal controller IPv4 address, netmask and gateway
- clears the event listener address
- clears all events
- deletes all cards
- sets all doors to `controlled` mode and 5 seconds delay
- clears all door passcodes


### `passcode`

1. If a supervisor passcode is entered for a door that is _normally closed_, the UHPPOTE controller will
   unlock the door and then immediately relock it. This seems anomalous and in this case the simulator 
   unlocks the door on the assumption that the supervisor code is intended to be an override.


### Events

_tl;dr; The UHPPOTE controller does not 'rollover' when the onboard event store is filled._

From experimentation, it appears that the UHPPOTE controller has an event store for approximately 200 000 events
(possibly varies varies with model/version). On filling the event buffer the controller seems to discard a _chunk_
of about 2048 events from the start of the event buffer to make space for new events. The event index continues to
increment monotonically.
